	desc = "Some said he was born from pure malice, others claimed him to be Satan himself. Prince Vlad Dracul, born 1428, was perhaps best known as a prominent member of The Order of the Dragon; leading many a crusade against the enemies of Christianity, particularly the Ottoman Empire. After vengeful Turks sent false news of Vlad's death to his wife Elisabeta, she committed suicide mere hours before his return. Devastated, the Prince returned to find her corpse surrounded by native holy men of the church, claiming her soul was damned to hell due to committing suicide. A then-enraged Vlad renounced God entirely, and lived on for centuries to terrorize humanity in a bitter bid for revenge concerning his bride's tragic death. Or so the legends speak. This suit of armor looks remarkably similar to one Vlad Dracul was often depicted wearing in ancient texts detailing his war ventures, and seems eerily occupied and perhaps even alive in it's hostilities."
